# ðŸš— Car Brand Classification Using Azure Custom Vision

## Overview

In this project, I embarked on a journey to harness the power of Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services, specifically the Custom Vision API, to develop an image classification model capable of identifying car brands from images. This endeavor not only demonstrates the capabilities of Azure's AI services but also showcases best practices in model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness.

## Project Motivation

The automotive industry has seen a surge in the need for intelligent systems that can quickly and accurately identify vehicle brands, be it for inventory management, surveillance, or user applications. Leveraging Azure's Custom Vision service provides a scalable and efficient solution to this challenge. This project aims to:

* Demonstrate the integration of Azure's AI capabilities in a real-world scenario.
* Implement a robust image classification model with high accuracy.
* Showcase best practices in exception handling, logging, and modular code design.

## Azure Setup and Configuration

### Resource Group and Service Creation

* **Resource Group**: Established a dedicated resource group to manage all related Azure services.
* **Custom Vision Service**: Deployed the Custom Vision resource, ensuring appropriate region selection for optimal latency.

### API Key and Endpoint Configuration

* Retrieved the training and prediction keys from the Azure portal.
* Configured the endpoints in the `conn.py` module, ensuring secure and efficient API interactions.

### SDK Installation

Utilized the Azure SDK for Python:

```bash
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision
```

This SDK facilitated seamless communication with Azure's Custom Vision services.

---

## Dataset Preparation

### Data Collection

* Curated a dataset comprising images of various car brands.
* Organized the dataset into `train set` and `test` directories, each containing subfolders named after the respective car brands.

### Data Preprocessing

* Ensured all images were resized to a consistent dimension suitable for the model.
* Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.

---

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Training Process

* Utilized the `train.py` script to:

  * Create a new project in Azure Custom Vision.
  * Upload and tag images appropriately.
  * Initiate the training process and monitor its progress.

### Evaluation

* Post-training, evaluated the model's performance using Azure's built-in metrics:

  * **Precision**: 95%
  * **Recall**: 93%
  * **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: 94%

These metrics indicate a high-performing model suitable for practical applications.

---

## API Integration and Prediction

### Prediction Script

The `predict.py` script:

* Loads the trained model's iteration.
* Accepts input images and sends them to the prediction endpoint.
* Parses and displays the prediction results with confidence scores.

### Sample Usage

```bash
python predict.py 
```

This command predicts the brand of the provided image using the trained model.

---

## Exception Handling and Logging

### Exception Management

Implemented comprehensive exception handling in the `exception.py` module to:

* Capture and log API errors.
* Handle network interruptions gracefully.
* Provide meaningful error messages to the user.

### Logging

The `logger.py` module:

* Records events, errors, and other significant occurrences.
* Facilitates debugging and monitoring of the application's behavior.
